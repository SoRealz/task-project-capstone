# React Application README

This README provides an overview of the structure and functionality of a React application based on the provided `App.jsx` file.

## Overview

This React application serves as a task management system, allowing users to view and manage their tasks. It includes features such as authentication, task listing, and task details.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Structure

The project structure follows a typical React application structure, with the main components organized into directories:

- **components**: Contains reusable UI components used throughout the application.
- **layouts**: Contains layout components that define the overall structure of the application.
- **pages**: Contains page components representing different views or routes of the application.
- **context**: Contains context providers and hooks for managing application-wide state.

## Functionality

### Authentication

The application includes authentication functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Users can log in and access protected routes based on their authentication status. JWT expiration is monitored, and users are automatically logged out when the token expires.

### Routes

The application uses React Router for client-side routing. The main routes and their corresponding components are defined in `App.jsx`. The routes include:

- **Home**: Displays the homepage of the application.
- **About**: Provides information about the application.
- **Tasks**: Displays a list of tasks. Users can navigate to individual task details.

### Error Handling

Error handling is implemented using React Router's error handling mechanism. An error page (`ErrorPage.jsx`) is displayed when navigation to a route fails or encounters an error.

## Development

During development, you can modify and extend the existing components and functionality to meet your project requirements. You can also add new components, pages, or routes as needed.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to a production environment, build the project using the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This command creates a production-ready build of the application in the `build` directory, which can be deployed to a web server or hosting platform.

## Dependencies

The application relies on several npm packages for its functionality, including:

- `react`: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `react-router-dom`: React bindings for declarative routing.
- `@tanstack/react-query`: Library for data fetching and caching.
- `bcrypt`: Library for hashing passwords (used on the server-side).
- Other dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
